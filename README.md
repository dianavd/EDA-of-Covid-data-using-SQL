## EDA-of-Covid-data-using-SQL
Explanatory Data analysis of Covid dataset using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
SQL is a useful resource for performing EDA on large datasets. 
The dataset I used is from the website https://ourworldindata.org.
Please, use this link for the latest data of Coronovirus (Covid-19).
I downloaded two datasets from that website. 
One is Covid Deaths worldwide which contains 26 variables and 260568 rows.
the second dataset is Covid Vaccinatations worldwide which contains 45 variables and 260568 rows.
To perform explonatory data analysis, I used Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.
